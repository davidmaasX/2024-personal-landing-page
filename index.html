              <h3>Design</h3>
              <p>I have experience with several programs focused on design, such as Adobe Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop, and also Figma, Sketch and Canva. I have designed apps, websites, web apps, a magazine, business cards and logos before.

              <h3>Web Development</h3>
              <p>I can code the <span class="bold-text">front-end</span> of a website, including exquisite designs and animations. For this, I count react.JS, jQuery to my skillset. If you need a website within a day, I can utilize Wordpress, Shopify or any other CMS like Drupal to come up with good website as well. The benefit of a CMS is speed. The disadvantage is there is less room for customization. 
                <br><br> I also have experience with <span class="bold-text">back-end</span> development. I have worked with Node.JS, Express.JS, and MongoDB. I have also worked with PHP and MySQL. I have created a web app including a RESTful API for the owner of a small online shop, which she uses to manage her inventory.

              <img class="left-pic" src="images/xlsm.png" alt="Excel">
              <h3>Excel VBA</h3>
              <p>With more than 10 years of experience, I can build locally running software based on VBA macros and a simple UI with <span class="bold-text"> Excel VBA</span>. This came in handy in Finance but  <br> <br> Over the years I have found that within a company, you often want a custom solution where a small database needs to be set up to get things running quickly, and you don't want to buy another subscription. When dealing with less than 50,000 data sets, Excel VBA is perfect for this. The downside I experienced where that functionality like UserForms (UI) or API links often only work only with Windows, not so well with Mac OS.</p>

              <h3>Finance & Management</h3>
              <p>I have worked at Commerzbank and Union Investment. I have also worked as a freelancer, and as an entrepreneur in e-commerce and business of trade. During those times, I have learned a lot about how to motivate people, and how to get the best out of them. 
                I have also learned how to manage projects, and how to manage a team. I have learned how to manage a start-up, and how to manage a budget.

              <h3>Blockchain</h3>
              <p>I have been involved in finance since 2012, bought my first bitcoin in 2013, I have been involved both as an investor and user of multiple blockchains s.a. Ethereum, Polygon, BNB, Cardano, and more. Building on these smart economies, I have been investing and making use of platforms offering liquid staking, collatoralized lending, prediction and derivatives markets. <br> <br> 
                My understanding is that DeFi will take up more market share of global finance over time, since it offers minimal transaction costs and a lot more power for the individual than society is used to as core principles. For this reason I am currently exlploring how to implement crypto payment terminals, smart contracts and utilitiy tokens into website in a user friendly way.</p>

             <h3>Cooking</h3>
             <p>In my free time, I cook healthy, delicious meals on a daily basis, with experience in international cuisine. Having a history of notoriously utlizing one special ingredient 
                - the pepperoni - has earned me the kitchen nickname "pepe".</p>
