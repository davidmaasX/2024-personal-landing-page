                <h3>Cooking</h3>
                <p>I cook healthy, delicious meals on a daily basis, with experience in international cuisine. Having a history of notoriously utlizing one special ingredient 
                    - the pepperoni - has earned me the nickname "douchebag". The latter sentence is meant as a joke, but I think it would be hilarious were it a real story.</p>

                <h3>Developing</h3>
                <p>I can code the <span class="bold-text">front-end</span> of a website, including exquisite designs and animations. For this, I count react.JS, jQuery to my skillset. If you need a website within a day, I can utilize Wordpress, Shopify or any other CMS like Drupal to come up with good website as well. The benefit of a CMS is speed. The disadvantage is there is less room for customization. 
                  <br><br> I also have experience with <span class="bold-text">back-end</span> development. I have worked with Node.JS, Express.JS, and MongoDB. I have also worked with PHP and MySQL. I have created a web app including a RESTful API for the owner of a small online shop, which she uses to manage her inventory.
                  <br><br> Additionally, I can <span class="bold-text">mock up a software quickly</span> using Excel & VBA. In 2020, I replaced a small library's software with one purely based on Excel. My solution had much shorter load times, did not crash, and it wasn't bloated with all the unusued functions and buttons of the initial software, which ran on MS Access as it was meant for much larger inventories. This database took me nearly two weeks to make, but I have heard the library (non-profit, less than 10,000 books) still uses it today. <br> <br> Over the years I have found that within a company, you often need very custom solutions to get things running quickly, and you don't want to buy another subscription. When dealing with less than 50,000 data sets, Excel VBA is perfect for this. VBA is how I've found out that I love to automate processes!

              <h3>Management</h3>
              <p>I have worked in companys s.a. Commerzbank, Union Investment and Parken & Mehr. I have also worked as a freelancer in financial services, and as an entrepreneur in the e-commerce and trading business. During those times, I have learned a lot about how to motivate people, and how to get the best out of them. 
                I have also learned how to manage projects, and how to manage a team. I have learned how to manage a start-up, and how to manage a budget.
